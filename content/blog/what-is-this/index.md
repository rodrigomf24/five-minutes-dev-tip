After reading [Dave Cedia's](https://daveceddia.com/start-blog-gatsby-netlify/) blog post about
building a blog with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), I felt encouraged to build my own.
After kicking around the idea of what should my blog be, I asked myself
"What kind of blog posts are interesting for me as a developer?", 
throught this question I ended up with the following list:

- Short blog posts that provide substancial and interesting information
- Short and educational blog posts
- Blog posts that I can put in practice as I read through them

Based on these answers I came up with the idea of a blog with posts
that can be read in 5 minutes, with content oriented for developers and
educational so it can be used as "tips" for daily tasks.

Once the idea was solidified, I decided to name it: 

> FMDT - Five Minutes Dev Tips

This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!
I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future, so stay tuned.
